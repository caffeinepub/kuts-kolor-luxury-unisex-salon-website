## Summary
**Goal:** Build an aesthetic 5-page marketing website for “KUTS & KOLOR Luxury Unisex Salon” with a consistent luxury-themed design and clear navigation.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement 5 routed pages: Home, About, Services, Gallery, Contact with a persistent header/nav and footer.
- Apply a coherent luxury salon visual theme (non blue/purple), consistent typography, spacing, and responsive layouts.
- Home page: prominently display salon name, a short value proposition, service category highlights (Hair, Skin, Nails) with emphasis on hair treatments and hair colour, and CTAs to call and/or book via dingg.app (external link).
- About page: include the provided description (grammar/clarity only), location context (Mumbai Central, Navjivan Society), and “Areas served: India”.
- Services page: present services grouped into Hair / Skin / Nails, with emphasized Hair Treatments and Hair Colour sections using scannable UI.
- Gallery page: responsive image grid using generated placeholder images from static assets, with modal/lightbox preview.
- Contact page: show full address, click-to-call phone number (091678 60528), hours (“Open · Closes 9 pm”), location context, and a clear external link to dingg.app.
- Add and integrate generated static images under frontend/public/assets/generated (hero, gallery placeholders, and service category visuals).

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can browse a responsive luxury-themed salon website across five pages, view service offerings and a gallery with image previews, and easily contact the salon or book externally via dingg.app.
